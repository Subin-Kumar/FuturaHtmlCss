            Main article: Ben 10 (2005 TV series)
            The series centers on Ben Tennyson, a 10-year-old boy on a summer vacation road trip with his cousin Gwen and their grandfather Max, who is later revealed to be a member of a secret intergalactic organization called the Plumbers. On their first night camping in their grandfather's RV, nicknamed the Rust Bucket, Ben finds a mysterious watch-like alien device that attaches itself upon his wrist, giving him the ability to transform into several (initially ten but later more) alien life-forms, each with special abilities. During their vacation, the Tennysons are attacked by various enemies, ranging from aliens such as intergalactic warlord Vilgax, bounty hunter duo Sixsix and Kraab, and Ectonurite high king Zs'skayr, criminals such as 11-year-old energy absorbing delinquent Kevin Levin, mad scientist Doctor Animo, and the mysterious paramilitary organization the Forever Knights, to supernatural entities such as interdimensional sorcerer Hex and his niece Charmcaster, and clown mastermind Zombozo and his Circus Freak Trio.

                The series begins five years after the events of the original series. Ben has removed the Omnitrix and returned to living a normal life, but he is forced to use it again to save his grandfather Max, who has been abducted by a xenophobic alien species called the Highbreeds as part of a plot to rid the Earth of human beings. Ben's age causes the Omnitrix to reboot, granting him access to new aliens along with a few from the original series. Ben is joined by Gwen and former enemy Kevin Levin as they fight the Highbreed's universal extermination plan.
